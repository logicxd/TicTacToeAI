# TicTacToeAI

Create an AI Tic-Tac-Toe bot that will never lose.

### Overview

* Built a Tic-Tac-Toe game for iPhone 4s.
* Made the bot with different implementations:
  1. Average score: the bot goes for the highest score available.
  2. Minimax score: the bot minimizes the player's score.
  3. Alpha-Beta pruning: Minimax with cut-offs to load the game faster.
  4. Rotations and reflections: Alpha-Beta pruning with even more cut-offs by using symmetry.
