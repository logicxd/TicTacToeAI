Average score: the bot goes for the highest score available.\r\n  2. Minimax score: the bot minimizes the player's score.\r\n  3. Alpha-Beta pruning: Minimax with cut-offs to load the game faster.\r\n  4. Rotations and reflections: Alpha-Beta pruning with even more cut-offs by using symmetry.\r\n\r\n![TicTacToeAI With Alpha-Beta pruning](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12219300/17745811/2886d658-6462-11e6-9b8c-235e978cefea.gif)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\nMy mentor [Rey](https://github.com/reygonzales) for guiding us through the assignment. This assignment was done together with  [Alaric](https://github.com/AlaricGonzales) at our internship at PlanChat.\r\n",
